Hero lab reader

First ruby program. 

The goal is to create a program that reads the POR files that are managed by the Herolab program and generate/report information that our GM can use during pathfinder gaming sessions.

This is still a work in progress. 

Current state:
The two main classes are not yet completed. The classes currently only return the character names and files within the POR zip file that need to be opened.

Rspec and testing
The file runner.rb is being used for basic testingnd to run rspec spec tests.

Rspec tests currrently just consists of checks for the existnace of the methods.
